C++ allows us to give more than one defination of an operator (overload) in same scope.

Operators that cannot be overloaded:
1) Scope Resolution Operator (::)
2) sizeof Operator
3) Member Selector (.)
4) Member pointer selector (*)
5) Ternary operator (?:)

Syntax:
Binary Operator:
    return type operator <operator symbol> (<right operand object>)
    left operand is accessed by this as:
        a + b
    can be interpretted as:
        a.add(b)

Note: Sorthand operaors need to be updated seperately.

Unary Oerator:
    Prefix:
        <class name> operator -- ()
    Postfix
        <class name> operator ++ (int)
        Here int contains zero and is passed as parameter for postfix operators.
