sort(arr, arr + n)
accepts arr + n as the last input as arr + n represents one more last address of the array while 
arr + n - 1 represnts the starting address of the last element of the array hence these are the passed
parameters.

sort() is defined in <algorithms> library. 

No comparision based sorting can be done in time less than O(n * log(n)).
Counting and radix sort are O(n) but they are not preferred as they only work when daata is within a 
given range and they cause a lot of space to be wasted by O(number of distict values in between).

Sort everything but last element:
    sort(v.begin(), v.end() - 1);

Sort everything but first element:
    sort(v.begin() + 1, v.end());
