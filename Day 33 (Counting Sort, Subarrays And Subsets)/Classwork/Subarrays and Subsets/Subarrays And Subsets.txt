Subarrays refer to a contiguous subset of an array. Note they are not the same as subset as subsets can both be non-contiguous that is taken ranomly and do not have repaeated elements. (Subarrays may have repeated elements). Example:
    For the array: 1 3 2 5 4 4

    1 2 5 is an subset but not a subarray.

    1 4 4 is a subset but not a subarray (Subset here has a repeated element due to a repeat being thee in the original, the repeat here are in reality diffeent elements).

    1 4 4 4 is neither a subset or subarray as the last 4 has to be a repeat, neither is it a subarray.

    132 is  botha subset and a subarray.

A subset of an array is a structure that has one-to-one mapping with elemnets of the array.

Total subsets of an array: 
    Either an element is mapped into subset or not. Every value is either mapped or not so each of the N elemnets have 2 choices hence total subsets are:
        2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * ... * 2 (N Multiplications)
        = pow(2, N)
    
    To visualise:
        Consider any array: {1, 2}
        The subsets are: {}, {1}, {2}, {1, 2}

        When we add a third element: {1, 2, 3}
        The subsets are just the same but with 3 added to them all:
            {}, {1}, {2}, {1, 2},
            {3}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}
        
Total subarrays of an array: 
    Subarrays of size 1: N
    Subarrays of size 2: N - 1
    Subarrays of size 3: N - 2
    ...
    Subarrays of size N: 1
    so total subarrays are: N + (N - 1) + (N - 2) + ... + 1
                           = (N - 1) * N/2
