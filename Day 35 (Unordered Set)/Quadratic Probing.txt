almost same as linear probing but here we use a quadratic value to get next search/insertion index.
    hash(k, i) = (hash(key), pow(i, 2)) mod 10

advantages:
    no extra space
    primary clustering resolved (as the next index is almost never returned after second collision).

disadvantage:
    branch tme is again O(n) as element could be in the full array.

    No gaurantee of finding a slot (as it is possible we may iterate over the filled slots while empty slots are present preventing expansion; this occurs only after array is half filled)

    secondary clustering still occurs.
