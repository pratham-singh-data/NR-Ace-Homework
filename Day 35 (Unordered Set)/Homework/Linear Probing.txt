Say we take a hash function(normal):
    hash(k) = k mod 10
hash function after probing:
    this one applies after a collision occurs to find the new location of insertion
    hash(k, i) = (hash(k) + i) mod 10
    here i is the number of times we have serached (initially 0)

    Note: that it in effect only return the next value to the current value i,e. say we tried to insert at n and and if n is filled insert at n + 1.

Advantage:
    No extra space is used. (Unlike in chaining where remaining space is left empy and linked list's extra space is consumed)

Diadvantage:
    branch time is O(n) as we may need to traverse the enture space to one before the first index i.e traverse the full array.

    deletion is difficul as value could be anywhere in the full array.

    primary clustering: elements get clustered causing more collisions to occur:
        a, space, space, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, space, space, i

    secondary clustering: when two ormore elements follow the same probe sequence: eg: a is assigned 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and b also ges 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and so on...
