Switch Case:
switch(v){
    case a: code; break;
    case b: code; break;
    and so on..
    default: code
}

this tells code to run for each value of v, only equality could be checked though. This basically works 
like a if else if sequence with the final else working like the final else in the sequence.

Here the break statement tells that execution is to end here else. In absence of break statement, the 
cases below the entry case also get executed, resulting in a fall through.
Note: break is simply syntax, it is not a loop and using continue returns an error.

Switch is more optimized than if-else as each key could get cached here. It can compare both strings and 
int.
