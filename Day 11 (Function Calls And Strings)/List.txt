1) Given a string containing only a, b and c (all lowercase) convert is such that: (use a function)
    a -> a
    b -> bb
    c -> ccc
    for all occurence of these values

2) You are given an array of integers and you have to find the result of:
    Say there are 5 students marks: s1, s2, s3, s4, s5;
    find:   s1 * (s2 + s3 + s4 + s5) +
            s2 * (s1 + s3 + s4 + s5) +
            s3 * (s1 + s2 + s4 + s5) +
            s4 * (s1 + s2 + s3 + s5) +
            s5 * (s1 + s2 + s3 + s4) +
