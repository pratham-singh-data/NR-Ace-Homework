Say we are given 24 which is 2 * 2 *  2 * 3 so return {(2, 3), (3, 1)}
300 is 2 * 2 * 5 * 5 * 3

Make a prime seive to get all prime numbers and then query the seive and reduce given number till we have the required breakdown.

herecomplexity is O(N long(log(n)) + q log(n))
as we will need log(n) time to search a prime for each query.
