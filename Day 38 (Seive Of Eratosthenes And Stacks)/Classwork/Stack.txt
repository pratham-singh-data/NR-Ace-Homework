Stacks are used for ordered linear storage, here items are stored in FIFO order (only top element (last added) is accessible)

    push(int element){
        top++;
        arr[top] = element
    }

This is used to add element to stack.

To get top value:
    topmost(){
        return arr[top]
    }

    handle cases such as empty stack(top == -1)

to remove an element:
    pop(){
        return arr[top--];
    }
