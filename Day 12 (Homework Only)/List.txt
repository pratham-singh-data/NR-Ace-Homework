1) Given an array of n integers and an integer x, Find total occurence of x in the array
Test Case:
    x = 5   n = 7
    array = [1, 2, 5, 3, 5, 6, 5]
    Output = 3

2) Given a string s pass it to a function that will return a string with the properties:
    if in the string 'a' was written enter 1 in that position. for 'b' enter '2'. And if it was x replace 
    with 24
    eg:
    input: abxy
    output: 122425

3) A string s is given , you have to generate an output such that from the pairs of adjacent,
    lexicographically smallest charachter will be removed. If a charachter is unpaired, returned it as it is.
    eg:
        input: electronics
        output: letois
