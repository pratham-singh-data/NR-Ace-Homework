Used to find the contiguous subarray of maximum sum;

The brute force method is:
    Say we are given:
     -5 4 6 -3 4 -1

We find each and every possible contiguous subarray:
-5 4 6 -3 4 -1
-5 4 6 -3 4
-5 4 6 -3
-5 4 6
-5 4
-5

4 6 -3 4 -1
4 6 -3 4
4 6 -3
4 6
4

6 -3 4 -1
6 -3 4
6 -3 4
6 -3
6

-3 4 -1
-3 4
-3

4 -1
4

-1

Calculate sum and complexity; here comlexity is O(n*n)

To optimise:
1) We cannot sort as order is important.
2) Now consider:
    a. If all numbers are positive we can add them all together and get that as result
    b. If a negative is involved, only add into subarray if value after addition is +ve. else drop 
    current subarray.
    This is O(n) solution.
