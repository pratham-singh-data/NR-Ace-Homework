Given an array holding the heights of blocks in a city flooded with wate, each index in the array tells the height of a block of with 1m, compute amount of water trapped in this area.

eg:
    n = 6
    arr[] = {3, 0, 0, 2, 0, 4}
    output: 10

At any given position the amount of water on a block depends on the minimum of the the right and left greatest heights.
