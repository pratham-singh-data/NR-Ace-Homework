Stacks when implements by arrays cause wastage of space as say we allocate 10 bytes of space but fill only 3 bytes worth of elements, he remaining space will remain unused. To solve this we use the linked list stack.

Note: Vectors still temporarily runs into this problem so we will use linked list here.

Also we know that
    push() => O(1)
    pop() => O(1)
    top() => O(1) 

To do this we will do:
    push(): insertAtHead()
    pop(): deleteFromHead()
    top(): displayHead()
